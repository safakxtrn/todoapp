# TO DO APP

This is a homework project for the React-Native Pathway at [Patika.dev](https://www.patika.dev/).

This application allows you to create and manage to-do list. In the application, there are things to do in a horizontally aligned list. At the top is the number of active tasks. You can add a new to-do from the bottom. The to-do you click on is marked as finished, its colour changes and a line is drawn through it. If you press on the to-do for a long time, a alert is displayed and you could delete the to-do.
